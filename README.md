Joey Lovato and Frank Schrama's Final Project for CSCI403 Databases (Colorado School of Mines)

# Details
In this project, we analyzed the statistics of RateMyProfessor, an online professor-rating platform. 

We used a database from Mendeley data provided by Jibo He: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fvtfjyvw7d/2

We uploaded the data into an SQL database, then performed various analyses. 

# Future Work
- Use Jibo's larger 5MB dataset, or scrape RateMyProfessor ourselves
- Provide statistics in a larger report or online
